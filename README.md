PokeDex Project

My kids and I are really into pokemon, and enjoy learning different things about each pokemon. I plan on creating a PokeDex app that allows the user to look up any pokemon they want and also create a favorite pokemon list. 

Integrated Features:
* Search for pokemon by name, search which pokemon are a certain type, search by move
* Add pokemon to a list of favorite pokemon
* Add a nickname to a pokemon
* Delete pokemon from list of favorite pokemon
* Update a pokemon's nickname

Technical Insight:
MauiBlazor or Razor pages will be used to create a user interface that is appealing to the user.
SQL lite/ EF Core will be used to create a database to store favorite pokemon
API will be used to connect to the Poke API website to pull data about pokemon
API to my internal data base to Add/Update/Delete 
Optional - deploy my application to the cloud using Azure
Data Models to turn JSON into usable data
